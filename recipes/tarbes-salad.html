        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p><strong>Tarbes salad</strong> is a sweet and sour salad that is both tasty and easy to make.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Salad</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 white or yellow onion</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                    <li>Â½ head your favorite lettuce</li>
                    <li>About 5 walnuts, broken into bits</li>
                    <li>1 ripe orange, cut into small pieces</li>
                    <li>Small chunk of hard blue or Roquefort cheese, diced</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Dressing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>50 ml extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>25 ml balsamic vinegar</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon whole grain mustard</li>
                    <li>1 squirt of lemon juice</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the onion into half moons and brown it in a bit of olive oil. Make it nice and crispy. Once it's done, put it aside in a bowl and squirt a bit of lemon juice on it.</li>
                <li>As the onion is cooking, wash the lettuce thoroughly. Soak it several times. Nothing is worse than gritty lettuce in a salad. Break the lettuce into bite-size pieces and drop them in your spinner under running water. Once it's washed, spin it until it's dry. Wet lettuce will dilute the dressing.</li>
                <li>Once the lettuce is dry, put it in a bowl. Add the onions, walnuts, orange and cheese.</li>
                <li>To make the dressing, just mix the ingredients in a jar and give them a good shake.</li>
                <li>Toss everything together in a big bowl and serve.</li>
            </ol>
