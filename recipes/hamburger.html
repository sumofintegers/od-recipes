    <h1>Hamburger</h1>

        <h2>Desciption</h2>
            <p>A hamburger is a variant on a sandwich involving a patty of ground meat, usually beef (known in the United Kingdom as a beefburger), or a vegetarian patty. A slice of cheese on the patty makes it a cheeseburger, a common variation in the United States.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>500 g (1.1 lb) minced / ground beef</li>
                <li>Herbs and spices (optional; see suggestions)</li>
                <li>Cheese (optional; see suggestions)</li>
                <li>Vegetables (lettuce, sprouts, tomato, onion etc; optional)</li>
                <li>1 hamburger bun per burger</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Shape the ground beef by hand into burger patties. You should get between 4–6 burgers from 500 g (1.1 lb) of beef.</li>
                <li>If adding optional ingredients, either season the outside or mix into the beef before forming the patties. Overworking the beef will result in mushy meat that won't stick together, so only mix the minimum necessary and do so by hand.</li>
                <li>Pan-fry or grill the patties for about 4–5 minutes on each side for burgers that aren't too thick. Ensure your burgers are fully cooked through before serving. If your burgers are quite thick or if you are unsure, you can cut one open to ensure the insides are browned. If the insides are red, there is a chance that the meat is not fully cooked. Alternately, you can insert a meat thermometer into the center of the burger, if the temperature reads less than 71°C (160°F), your burger is undercooked.</li>
                <li>Let the burger rest for several minutes before serving to let the juices cool down and not burst out at first bite.</li>
                <li>Serve each burger on a bun, optionally with relish, sliced pickles, ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, ranch dressing, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and/or onions.</li>
            </ol>
